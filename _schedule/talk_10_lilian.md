title: Catch up with the field by writing a high-quality machine learning blog
time: 1200
abstract: In this talk, I will use my personal journey of how I got into the field of deep learning as a case study for how to write a high-quality machine learning blog. I will talk about the general process of writing about a new topic and common difficulties that I often run into. Then I will compare the style of routine academic publications versus more casual blogging and point out pros and cons.
