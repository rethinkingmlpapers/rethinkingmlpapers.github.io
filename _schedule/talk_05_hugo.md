title: An honest conversation on the ML conference paper
time: 1000 - 1030
abstract: The conference paper is the dominating medium for scientific dissemination in the ML community. Yet, the ML community's favorite hobby is also quite possibly ... to complain about the ML conference paper! In this talk, I will attempt to piece out some potential reasons behind this situation of discontent. I will also lay out my own views on how we might be able to do better than the conference paper.
