title: Ya gotta make it obvious
time: 1230 - 1300
abstract: Half the human cortex is devoted to understanding our world visually and so it makes sense to leverage that processing power in order to understand, describe, and debug computational abstractions, such as machine learning models. The problem is that explaining our work visually often represents considerable extra effort, particularly if we want to employ animations.  It's also the case that we all have the urge to impress rather than illuminate.  Taken together, this can lead to papers, lectures, and classes that don't actually transmit ideas to others.  We should value simple and clear expositions most of all, making the key ideas obvious, even if it requires extraordinary effort.  We should not accept the status quo, and constantly ask ourselves if these are the best explanations and visualizations we can make. This short talk will demonstrate some state-of-the-art visualizations from explained.ai and describe their backstories.
