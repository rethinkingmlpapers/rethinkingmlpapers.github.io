title: Case studies for interactive demonstration of machine learning models on the web browser
time: 0900
abstract: While papers are the main means for the scientists to communicate results, both quantitative and qualitative ones, to the scientific community, the expectations in the machine learning community have moved above and beyond the paper format. Machine models are expected to be ultimately used by people, in devices, computers, and other applications. In recent years we have witnessed the popularity of works that are also published as a web article along with interactive demos, enabling the reader to interact with machine learning research models to experience the features and also the limitations of cutting edge methods. This comes with costs, as development and deployment of such interactive websites consume time and energy from the researcher's point of view. In particular, the audience may find flaws in the model by interacting with it in ways unintended by the authors who simply wish to report a score against a benchmark. In this talk, I will discuss my own experiences of developing these interactive web browser demos for my own research and also other interactive web browser demos in the literature as a series of case studies. By the end of the talk, the audience will be familiar with the different types of approaches and their tradeoffs used in the development of web demos for research, to be able to assess whether it is something they wish to do for their own projects.
