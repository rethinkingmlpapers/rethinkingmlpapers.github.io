title: From competitions to coopetitions to drive open innovation
time: 1100
abstract: When data became a first class citizen in driving innovation, several competition platforms emerged defining data-driven challenges as a way to bring solutions to global or business problems. In contrast, Codalab was designed to create a collaborative ecosystem for conducting computational Machine Learning research in an efficient, open and reproducible manner. The goals of CodaLab were threefold 1) reduce duplication of effort; 2) enable reproducibility of the experiment with comparable baselines; 3) encourage the community to work collaboratively to solve grand challenges. The community was further developed as part of the Challenges in Machine Learning (CiML) workshop series which brings the broader community of challenge organisers and participants together on a yearly basis at NeurIPS. CiML provides an opportunity to share best practices across platforms, define higher impact challenges for research, education or innovation while fostering diversity in the community of participants and organisers to address global and local challenges.
