# Abstract for the papers
abstract: The developers of the Automunge open source platform for tabular data preprocessing have taken a somewhat unorthodox approach to documentation and communications, making use of multimedia, blogging, tweets, jupyter notebooks, as well as music and photography in publication. This submission will offer an exhibited excerpt of such communication practices, featuring elements of multimedia videos with narration, accompanied with hand drawn slides and transcript, presented as both a brief introduction and extended walkthrough. We believe this form of presentation is a very accessible low cost option to communicate complex subject matter in a concise and accessible form. Further examples are also provided in the references.
