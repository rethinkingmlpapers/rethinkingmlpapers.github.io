# TL;DR
tldr: We propose an exhibit on our new programming language I❤️LA which compiles markdown-like linear algebra code to C++, Python or LaTeX.

# Abstract for the papers
abstract: I❤️LA is a compilable markdown for math. It can generate working code in C++ and Python (and more to come). The same I❤️LA code can also generate LaTeX which is in turn rendered as beautifully typeset math. The I❤️LA code creates a publishable artifact and reference implementations. We believe I❤️LA can improve expositional clarity, code reproducibility and interoperability, and scientific education. We focus our initial efforts on mathematical expressions found in the wild within the Computer Graphics community, but plan to extend our work to the larger Machine Learning and Computer Science community. In our proposed Rethinking ML Papers exhibit, we will demonstrate results of our large-scale study and an interactive demo application.
