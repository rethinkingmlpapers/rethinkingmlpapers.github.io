# Abstract for the papers
abstract: Comic strips are a naturally appealing medium which provide a visually-attractive means for situating scientific results within a narrative. Although they may not be relevant to all situations and can be time-consuming to produce, they also provide unique opportunities for humor and levity that may be an important tool in disseminating and convincing an audience of the merits of a paper. Furthermore, their decomposition into panels makes it easy to annotate them using standard accessibility tools for images. This paper presents the case for presenting scientific posters as comic strips, using the author's 2018 SacreBLEU poster as a motivating example.
