# Abstract for the papers
abstract: The need for innovating scientific publications is felt across various research fields. In the last thirty years, the publishing process is accelerating, and new research is coming out every day. In Machine Learning, some attempts have been made to keep track of recent publications and to enhance open access articles for allowing authors to integrate multimedia contents. However, it is still hard to compare selected articles exhaustively. Thus, we envision a Machine Learning Papers Museum as a metaphorical solution for providing a digital space where users can explore publication collections in guided and serendipitous ways.
